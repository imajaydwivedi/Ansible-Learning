Modules and Collections
-----------------------------------------

-> Ansible modules provide the Ansible core functionality

-> Modules provide a uniform way to run specific tasks on different environments.

-> By using well-written Ansible modules, the Ansible user doesn't have to
    worry about operational differences between Linux Distributions

    -> The package module can be used to install software packages on any Linux distributions

The ansible-core package comes with modules that are commonly used.


Ansible Content Collections
------------------------------

-> A large amount of modules is available, additional modules can be provided by
    using Ansible Content Collections.

-> Many content collections exist, each providing a different set of modules.

-> Ansible Content Collections are provided through galaxy.ansible.com.

-> To manage specific assets, content collections may have to be installed, which
    we will cover later.

-> To make working with content collections easier, Ansible Navigator can be used.
